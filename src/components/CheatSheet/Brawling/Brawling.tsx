      Sometimes a character will attack without a weapon, striking with a fist
      or foot. This is called brawling. Normal characters do 1d3 points of
      subduing damage with a punch, 1d4 with a kick; kicks are rolled at a -2
      attack penalty. A character in no armor or leather armor cannot
      successfully punch or kick a character in metal armor, and in fact, if
      this is attempted the damage is applied to the attacker instead of the
      defender. The GM must decide which monsters can be successfully attacked
      this way. All character classes may engage in brawling; there is no
      “weapon” restriction in this case.
