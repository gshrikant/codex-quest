      If applicable, the GM rolls a 1d6. Characters are usually surprised on a
      1-2, or in the case of a well-prepared ambush on a 1-4. Deafened
      characters are surprised on a 1-3 and blinded characters on a 1-4. Elves
      are surprised on a 1 normally, 1-2 if deafened, and 1-3 when blinded or in
      ambushes. Characters who are surprised cannot act in the first combat
      round, though they can defend themselves and so have normal AC.
